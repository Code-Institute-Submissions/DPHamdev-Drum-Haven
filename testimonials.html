                            This service did exactly as was advertised. My drums had suffered a lot of rust due to previous living conditions. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The hardware was coated black and this meant to remove the rust we lost a bunch of the coating. 
                            Although I was warned this would happen before drum haven continued with the work.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My drums came  back with a kind of "antiqued" look which I think Actually looks good. 
                            Apart from damage I had caused to the paint work myself my kit came back looking brand new.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Very happy

                            Took my snare drum to Ken for a tune up after buying one second hand which he made studio ready. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Knows what he's doing and clearly spends a lot of time with each drum!
                            Would recommend to anyone wanted to get the most out of their kit
                        </p>

                            My kit has never sounded better! Was finished within a few days at a very fair price. Definitely the place to go to give your kit some TLC.
